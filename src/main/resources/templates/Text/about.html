					surprising. for example.</h3>
				<h3>o Kind Canadians (holding the door for other person,
					To explain kindly)</h3>
				<h3>o A teacher like a friend. o Paying in the seat.</h3>
				<h3>o Calls not allowed on the subway. Of course, no data
					transffering.</h3>
				<h3>o Delivery culture is not very widespread o Unkindness in
					government offices</h3>
				<h3>o Many strikes</h3>
				<h3>o There are many times when the subway</h3>
				<h3>o a heavy smoker on the street o English

				<h3>Next is the expected experience. When I actually came here,
					I realized it was the same thing that I expected.</h3>
				<h3>o clean air : got a fresh air. I think it's because there
					are so many trees and lots of land.</h3>
				<h3>o Lots of parks :(Everywhere I can find healing Parks).</h3>
				<h3>o The breadth of the land</h3>
				<h3>o It's Cold</h3>

				<h3>As we saw above, the experience and images before and after
					coming to Canada have different things and the same things. but
					much of things were different than I thought, and I think, the
					culture that should be appreciated the most in Canada's is to
					respect diversity and to be considerate and respectful of others.</h3>
