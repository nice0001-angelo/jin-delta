				<br /> <span class="label label-primary">Jee</span>
				<h4>I liked to write and draw when I was very young, also I was
					good at all kinds of sports thanks to my parents. I was very quiet
					and was always thinking of something myself and enjoyed imaging my
					future and something interesting. In addition, Korean education is
					very systematic and sometimes forced. I studied very hard and did
					well in math. In fact, Koreans’ level of study and academic
					enthusiasm seem to be the top in the world. I don’t like this
					Korean style education, but ironically, this method of education is
					the driving power behind my lifestyle, patience, and persistence.
					Practically, I strongly believe that there is nothing human cannot
					do. I graduated from university, and I worked for public company.
					After I got married, my life changed dramatically. I am living so
					busy with my husband and children, my present life is absolutely
					not quiet, and my family comes before me now.</h4>

					<h2>Inspiration from mother</h2>
					<br /> <span class="label label-danger">Michelle</span>
					<h4>I found a real passion in my career which is inspired by
						my mother and our home’s kitchen. My potential culinary capacity
						was built-up by mother who taught me fundamental knowledge and
						transmitted valuable experiences during her cooking journey</h4>
					<br /> <span class="label label-primary">Jee</span>
					<h4>When it was my first time and not easy to take care of my
						baby, I got a lot of help from my mother. She always gave me
						courage, hope and support. She is the owner chef of a Japanese
						restaurant in Korea. Furthermore, she is good at all Korean
						cuisine. Her strengths are thorough hygiene and consistent
						devotion. I started to help her job and I learned and realized a
						lot from serving, cashiers, kitchen assistants and even buying
						ingredients. This was a real world of the restaurant, not a
						practice. Now and forever, I think the greatest thing in the world
						is mother.</h4>
					<br />

					<h2>In pursuit of dreams...</h2>
					<br /> <span class="label label-danger">Michelle</span>
					<h4>With strong support from my family and friends, I soon
						moved to Toronto for culinary school to further my skills. In this
						space, I feel free to share savory and healthy recipes that I love
						to cook and eat in personal or frequently with my friends. This
						food blog may inspire those have common interest, passion and
						creativity like me with food will have the opportunity to cook for
						yourself and your acquaintances, or even apply it further on your
						culinary career.</h4>
					<br /> <span class="label label-primary">Jee</span>
					<h4>I was living so busy in Korea, working at the mom’s
						restaurant, raising children, buying a house and traveling many
						countries. My hard times passed naturally, and I came here to
						Canada last summer by the time my life was the most stable. I
						registered Culinary Management because I wanted learn the whole
						course in professional cooking theory, hygiene and practical
						cooking. Of course, life in Canada is strange and English is
						difficult, but I have a dream now and I will never give up. I want
						to take responsibility for what I choose as far as I can.</h4>
					<br />
				</div>
				<div id="section4">
					<h2>For Our future???</h2>
					<h4>We thought a lot about our life, cooking, our home
						countries and Canada while starting this food blog. For example,
						Korea offers free lunch to all of public school students.
						Surprisingly, it is not low quality meals and is also not cheap
						ingredients. Nutritionists manage daily diets carefully and use
						organic ingredients. There is even parents monitors regularly.
						Most children love school lunch very much and to be honest, it is
						often tastier than mom’s. There is always fresh fruits and
						vegetables on every week day and there is birthday cake and ice
						cream on a special day. Of course, Canadian mothers didn’t believe
						this so far! They said Canadian consisted of various races;
						therefore, a nutritionist can’t cook according to the tastes of
						all students. Their prediction is very interesting. How can we
						apply the merits of our home countries here? How can Canadians
						live more comfortably? The answer to this will be our task in the
						future. Ultimately, we want to contribute to Canada in the field
						of cooking and baking by making our effort and more creative
						ideas.</h4>
					<br />
					<h4>As a first step to become a good chef, now we basically
						have to eat hard to distinguish between good taste and aroma.
						Let’s continue eating over and over!</h4>

					<h4>Baek Jong Won grew up in a rich family, entered a top

						food. For example, Baek, who graduated from the Department of
						Social Work (not Culinary) had a very interesting university life.
						Instead of studying, he traveled across the country in search of
						tasty restaurants, which helped him accumulate an extensive and
						comprehensive knowledge of food. He would often cook for his
						classmates and soon became a central figure in his department.
						Baek, enjoy eating and likes friendly, simple, but delicious rice

				<h3>When I had not experienced Canada, there were some

					winter is very long and the weather is extremely cold; therefore,
					there are many famous brands of clothing such as Canada Goose or

				<br />
				<h3>From now on, I want to talk about my experience after
					arriving in Canada. First, I want to write about the many things I
					have felt through my daily life. Actually, I felt and experienced
					many things while living here with my children and husband. The
					most importantly, there are people from many different cultures in
					Canada. For example, my daughter’s class has friends from many
					countries. They are friends who were originally born in Canada or
					from Spain, China and Brazil; therefore, I met lots of parents from
					many different countries. They are all very kind and helpful to me
					as someone who experienced Canada before me. At first, I couldn’t
					speak English very well, so I was very worried about talking to
					them. However, they gladly helped me, kindly explained and invited
					me. The kindness and consideration for the stranger was the first
					impression of me and the children about the Canadians.</h3>

				<h4>
					<span class="label label-success">Various People</span>
				</h4>
				<br />
				<h3>Moreover, Canadians and Canadian culture are too different
					from South Korea. The experiences were not known before coming to
					Canada, so they were even more surprising. For instance, the
					teacher is like a friend, we call the teacher’s name. I can’t
					imagine it in Korea. When I first came in George Brown College, I
					call my teacher “teacher”, but she explained to me that it’s like
					she calls me “student”, so I called her name. This is a cultural
					difference in language and title. Second, I feel a lot of cultural
					differences on the subway. The telephone and the Internet are not
					working well on the subway, so the subway is relatively quiet; in
					contrast, subway in Korea were always noisy with the voices of
					people on the phone. Also, the seat is empty, Canadian usually ask
					me to sit down first.</h3>

			<h3>Third, Canadian use the words sorry, excuse me, or thank you

				speak the most here.</h3>

			<h3>Canadians and Americans seem to be much different including

					The Canadians that I experienced recognize each other, respect each
