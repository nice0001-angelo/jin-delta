				<h2>Our Yesterday and Today</h2>
				<div>
					<br />
					<h4>
						<span class="label label-danger">Michelle</span>
					</h4>
					<h4>a lifestyle blogger and studying Baking Art Management in
						Toronto, Canada. I’ve loved to be a writer and adventure seeker in
						the hospitality field in general. Fueled by travelling, cooking,
						baking, tasting a fusion of the cuisine. After graduating at
						Bachelor of International Business, I got a good job yet just felt
						that everything was satisfied and smooth for the short-term</h4>
				</div>
				<div>
					<br />
					<h4>
						<span class="label label-primary">Jee</span>
					</h4>
					<h4>I liked to write and draw when I was very young, also I
						was good at all kinds of sports thanks to my parents. I was very
						quiet and was always thinking of something myself and enjoyed
						imaging my future and something interesting. In addition, Korean
						education is very systematic and sometimes forced. I studied very
						hard and did well in math. In fact, Koreans’ level of study and
						academic enthusiasm seem to be the top in the world. I don’t like
						this Korean style education, but ironically, this method of
						education is the driving power behind my lifestyle, patience, and
						persistence. Practically, I strongly believe that there is nothing
						human cannot do. I graduated from university, and I worked for
						public company. After I got married, my life changed dramatically.
						I am living so busy with my husband and children, my present life
						is absolutely not quiet, and my family comes before me now.</h4>
					<br />

						<h2>Inspiration from mother</h2>
						<br />
						<h4>
							<span class="label label-danger">Michelle</span>
						</h4>
						<h4>I found a real passion in my career which is inspired by
							my mother and our home’s kitchen. My potential culinary capacity
							was built-up by mother who taught me fundamental knowledge and
							transmitted valuable experiences during her cooking journey</h4>
						<br />
						<h4>
							<span class="label label-primary">Jee</span>
						</h4>
						<h4>When it was my first time and not easy to take care of my
							baby, I got a lot of help from my mother. She always gave me
							courage, hope and support. She is the owner chef of a Japanese
							restaurant in Korea. Furthermore, she is good at all Korean
							cuisine. Her strengths are thorough hygiene and consistent
							devotion. I started to help her job and I learned and realized a
							lot from serving, cashiers, kitchen assistants and even buying
							ingredients. This was a real world of the restaurant, not a
							practice. Now and forever, I think the greatest thing in the
							world is mother.</h4>
					</div>

						<br />
						<h2>In pursuit of dreams...</h2>
						<br />
						<h4>
							<span class="label label-danger">Michelle</span>
						</h4>
						<h4>With strong support from my family and friends, I soon
							moved to Toronto for culinary school to further my skills. In
							this space, I feel free to share savory and healthy recipes that
							I love to cook and eat in personal or frequently with my friends.
							This food blog may inspire those have common interest, passion
							and creativity like me with food will have the opportunity to
							cook for yourself and your acquaintances, or even apply it
							further on your culinary career.</h4>
						<br />
						<h4>
							<span class="label label-primary">Jee</span>
						</h4>
						<h4>I was living so busy in Korea, working at the mom’s
							restaurant, raising children, buying a house and traveling many
							countries. My hard times passed naturally, and I came here to
							Canada last summer by the time my life was the most stable. I
							registered Culinary Management because I wanted learn the whole
							course in professional cooking theory, hygiene and practical
							cooking. Of course, life in Canada is strange and English is
							difficult, but I have a dream now and I will never give up. I
							want to take responsibility for what I choose as far as I can.</h4>
					</div>
					<br />
					<div id="section4">
						<br />
						<h2>For Our future</h2>
						<br />
						<h4>We thought a lot about our life, cooking, our home
							countries and Canada while starting this food blog. For example,
							Korea offers free lunch to all of public school students.
							Surprisingly, it is not low quality meals and is also not cheap
							ingredients. Nutritionists manage daily diets carefully and use
							organic ingredients. There is even parents monitors regularly.
							Most children love school lunch very much and to be honest, it is
							often tastier than mom’s. There is always fresh fruits and
							vegetables on every week day and there is birthday cake and ice
							cream on a special day. Of course, Canadian mothers didn’t
							believe this so far! They said Canadian consisted of various
							races; therefore, a nutritionist can’t cook according to the
							tastes of all students. Their prediction is very interesting. How
							can we apply the merits of our home countries here? How can
							Canadians live more comfortably? The answer to this will be our
							task in the future. Ultimately, we want to contribute to Canada
							in the field of cooking and baking by making our effort and more
							creative ideas.</h4>
						<br />
						<h4>As a first step to become a good chef, now we basically
							have to eat hard to distinguish between good taste and aroma.
							Let’s continue eating over and over!</h4>

						</h3>
						<br />
						<h4>Baek Jong Won grew up in a rich family, entered a top
							university in south korea, and was always in a stable
							environment, but all he wanted was not economic stability but
							making taste food. For example, Baek, who graduated from the
							Department of Social Work (not Culinary) had a very interesting
							university life. Instead of studying, he traveled across the
							country in search of tasty restaurants, which helped him
							accumulate an extensive and comprehensive knowledge of food. He
							would often cook for his classmates and soon became a central
							figure in his department. Baek, enjoy eating and likes friendly,
							simple, but delicious rice and food more than expensive and
							complex luxury dishes. It is Korean homemade food. It is a
							home-made meal including a mother's finger touch and heart. His
							pursuit of Food style similar with us, Jee and Mitchell, and It
