							liked to write and draw when I was very young, also I was good at
							all kinds of sports thanks to my parents. I was very quiet and
							was always thinking of something myself and enjoyed imaging my
							future and something interesting. In addition, Korean education
							is very systematic and sometimes forced. I studied very hard and
							did well in math. In fact, Koreans’ level of study and academic
							enthusiasm seem to be the top in the world. I don’t like this
							Korean style education, but ironically, this method of education
							is the driving power behind my lifestyle, patience, and
							persistence. Practically, I strongly believe that there is
							nothing human cannot do. I graduated from university, and I
							worked for public company. After I got married, my life changed
							dramatically. I am living so busy with my husband and children,
							my present life is absolutely not quiet, and my family comes

						<h4>
							<span

								thought a lot about our life, cooking, our home countries and
								Canada while starting this food blog. For example, Korea offers
								free lunch to all of public school students. Surprisingly, it is
								not low quality meals and is also not cheap ingredients.
								Nutritionists manage daily diets carefully and use organic
								ingredients. There is even parents monitors regularly. Most
								children love school lunch very much and to be honest, it is
								often tastier than mom’s. There is always fresh fruits and
								vegetables on every week day and there is birthday cake and ice
								cream on a special day. Of course, Canadian mothers didn’t
								believe this so far! They said Canadian consisted of various
								races; therefore, a nutritionist can’t cook according to the
								tastes of all students. Their prediction is very interesting.
								How can we apply the merits of our home countries here? How can
								Canadians live more comfortably? The answer to this will be our
								task in the future. Ultimately, we want to contribute to Canada
								in the field of cooking and baking by making our effort and more
								creative ideas.</span>

								Jong Won grew up in a rich family, entered a top university in

								wanted was not economic stability but making taste food. For
								example, Baek, who graduated from the Department of Social Work
								(not Culinary) had a very interesting university life. Instead
								of studying, he traveled across the country in search of tasty
								restaurants, which helped him accumulate an extensive and
								comprehensive knowledge of food. He would often cook for his
								classmates and soon became a central figure in his department.
								Baek, enjoy eating and likes friendly, simple, but delicious
								rice and food more than expensive and complex luxury dishes. It
								is Korean homemade food. It is a home-made meal including a
								mother's finger touch and heart. His pursuit of Food style
